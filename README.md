特別聲明：本軟件僅在民主國家遵循Apache 2.0協議，極權國家禁止使用該軟件。至於如何鑑定極權國家，可按照以下標準：單一個人掌握最高權力累計超過十年，亦或單一組織掌握國家政權連續超過20年，這樣的國家構成事實獨裁；對於新建立的政權，凡實行一人制或一黨制的國家或地區都被認定為極權。常見的極權國家有：俄羅斯、中國、阿聯酋、新加坡等。我們呼籲更多的開源軟件以及跨國商業加入這一反極權條款。
Special statement: This software only follows the Apache 2.0 protocol in democratic countries. The use of this software is prohibited in totalitarian countries. As for how to identify a dictatorship, the following standards can be used: the same person has held the highest power for more than ten years, or the same organization has held state power for more than 20 consecutive years. Such a country constitutes a factual dictatorship; for newly established regimes, if dictator or only one party dominates the country, which is also dictatorship. Common totalitarian countries include Russia, China, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, etc. We call on more open source software and transnational business to join this anti-dictatorship clause(ADC).
